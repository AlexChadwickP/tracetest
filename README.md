# Overview

Testing and debugging software built on Micro-Services architectures is hard. Lots of services, multiple teams, written in various languages, with many different technologies involved. How are you expected to write tests across all this complexity?

Tracetest makes it easy. Pick an api to test. Tracetest uses your tracing infrastructure to trace this api call. This trace is the blueprint of your system, showing all the steps. Use this blueprint to graphically define assertions on different services throughout the trace, checking return statuses, data, or even execution times of systems.

Once the test is built, it can be run automatically as part of a build process. Every test has a trace attached, allowing you to immediately see what worked, and what did not, reducing the need to reproduce the problem to see the underlying issue.

Weâ€™re looking for feedback to help make Tracetest even better for developers, QA testers, and DevOPs. Please give us feedback on [Discord](https://discord.gg/eBvEQRVyKX) or [create an issue on Github](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/issues/new/choose)

# Getting Started

Check out the [Installation](https://kubeshop.github.io/tracetest/installing/) and
[Getting Started](https://kubeshop.github.io/tracetest/getting-started/) guides to set up Tracetest and
run your first tests! It is still a 'work in progress' so please provide us with any and all [feedback](https://github.com/kubeshop/tracetest/issues/new/choose) - we live for input and will respond!

Follow us on [Twitter at @tracetest_io](https://twitter.com/tracetest_io) for updates
